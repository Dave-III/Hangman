# Hangman

A hangman project, using [this word list](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

---
## Todo List (Early)
 - [ ] Determine scoring system for word complexity
 - [ ] Filter out words not following common conventions (e.g. vowels, `u` after `q`, etc.)
 - [ ] Migrate old hangman project
 - [x] Migrate old hangman solver
 - [x] Add coloured terminal text via ANSI colour codes
 - [x] combine both scoring systems
 - [ ] ascii hangman for later on when you can actually play the game (Future)
 - [ ] collect human data guesses to find on average what characters humans are guessing to influence our weight scale (Future)
 - [ ] implement a proper hangman minigame in which the user can enter letters and the program will return visualised results. (Future)
 - [x] Inline buffering screen for long processings (e.g. Loading...)
 - [ ] Implement Main function to run all processes
 - [ ] Finish implementing webscraping code to remove all non-dictionary words, excluding plurals (Future).
 - [ ] Add probability-based stats for average/optimal letter selection in the hangman game

 I dont want this list to be too overwhelming lol, so I'm trying to limit all the things that I add to it.
