A hangman project, using [this word list](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words).

---
## Todo List (Early)
 - [ ] Determine scoring system for word complexity
 - [ ] Filter out words not following common conventions (e.g. vowels, `u` after `q`, etc.)
 - [ ] Migrate old hangman project
 - [ ] Add coloured terminal text via ANSI colour codes
 - [ ] Proper word sorting, removes abbreviated words
 - [ ] combine both scoring systems
 - [ ] ascii hangman for later on when you can actually play the game (Future)
